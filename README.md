# Vote2Cap-DETR-master-deform
This project builds on "End-to-End 3D Dense Captioning with Vote2Cap-DETR" and "Vote2Cap-DETR++." It uses deformable attention similar to Deformable DETR. However, due to the use of KNN, memory consumption is extremely high. Currently, voxelization is being explored to reduce memory usage.
